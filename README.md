# Scream Detection on Raspberry Pi

This project detects screams in real-time audio using a machine learning model. Designed to run on a Raspberry Pi with a connected microphone.

## Project Structure

- `scream_detector.py` – Main script for running the model.
- `scaler.pkl` – StandardScaler object for feature scaling.
- `model.pkl` – Trained scream detection model (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM).
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies.

## Installation (on Raspberry Pi)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shaikshifa18/scream_detection.git
   cd scream_detection/Converted_Separately
